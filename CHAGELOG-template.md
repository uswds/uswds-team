Create an itemized list of all user-affected changes using the following format:
```
- Summarize the change with a brief statement (#[Related PR])
  - If necessary, describe the change in more detail in a nested list item. Not every change needs a description. 
  - :warning: :pushpin: Indicate if the change requires a markup update or is a breaking change by using the appropriate symbol 
    and explain what action the user must take
```
Whenever possible, change items should:
- Include a brief description of the update that focuses on user benefit
- Include a link to the related PR
- Use plain language and be human-readable.
- Use a consistent set verbs to begin each statement. 
  Examples: "Fixed", "Added", "Improved", "Optimized" at the start of the summary helps indicate change type
- Make content scannable by keeping lines short
- Be categorized under the appropriate section headings, found below.
