# Welcome to the USWDS Team repo
This new repo is an experiment in using GitHub to better manage team- and product-related issues and assets that either do not apply directly to USWDS code, guidance, or documentation; or to big-picture product [roadmap items](https://github.com/orgs/uswds/projects/4) that may cross multiple repos.

We consider this repo to be mostly an internal resource, but anyone should feel free to open issues and comment, especially on issues and stories that affect the broader USWDS community.
